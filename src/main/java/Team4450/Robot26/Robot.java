      // sec to execute. It's very hard to stay under this limit. So...copied classes
      // from the wpilib name space to inside this project and modified them to allow
      // us to control these warnings and log some of them to our log file. The
      // warnings
      // from IterativeRobotBase can be turned on/off and the timeout set. Any
      // warnings
      // from that class will go to our log file. The CommandScheduler also generates
      // essentially the same warnings but copying that is getting beyond what we
      // should
      // be doing, so we just set its internal timeout (because it allows us to) to a
      // longer value to turn off its warnings. It does not log to our log file. These
      // warnings can be turned back on at times to check if we are having significant
      // overruns but turned off if things look ok. This is a major hack, the downside
      // of which is that with each yearly release of Wpilib the copied files would
      // have
      // to be recopied and remodified to make sure our copies are up to date.

      // pull in these modified classes. Look for "4450" in the code for the mods.
